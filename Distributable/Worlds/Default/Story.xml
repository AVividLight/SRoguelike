			<text>[1] Dear Diary, I'm having second thoughts. I don't know what I've gotten myself into. Back home, the tales of this new land were of mystery, and adventure; wonders greater than anything ever seen, and riches more abundant than sunlight. However, the closer we get to the portal, the more the stories change.
				
				Terrible monsteres, and devious traps are said to await the wearisome traveler. I hear tales of treachery and subterfuge, almost as if the air itself turns adventurer against companion. I wish I hadn't been so foolish. I don't have the funds to turn back, and hardly the will to continue. Perhaps it's not as bad as they say.</text>

			<text>[2] Dear Diary, I have had another poor night of sleep. Hardly a wink since sundown. At least this is the last time I'll have to lie on the carriage floor; our driver tells us we'll arrive at the portal by morning. I don't know how dangerous the land beyond will be, but at least I'll get a full night of rest there.
				
				Between the constant jostling from the large roots on the trail floor, and the terrible stories the locals tell, this four moon journey to the portal may end up worse than whatever's on the other side. I am still concerned, but these stories are too fantastical. Surely, most of them have been made up.</text>

			<text>[3] Dear Diary, Our carriage finally arrived a short time ago. The portal is much larger than I expected, perhaps twice the height of The Royal Family's castle. There are many people here, more than I expected, and the 'encampment' around the portal is more like a village. It even has it's own keep!
				
				At least fifty guards are watching the portal at all times, both night and day. Is there really a need for this? Has anything bad ever come out? No one has been willing to answer these questions, so I'm left to wonder. Personally, I believe they're just reacting to the stories of drunken adventurers, too scared to themselves enter the portal.</text>

			<text>[4] Dear Diary, It has been a few nights since I last wrote. I was starting to wonder why they weren't letting us enter the portal, when, far past sundown, an old man knocked on the door to my room at the inn. He confirmed my suspicions; the local guards have been instructed to prevent anyone from accessing the portal. I don't know when this order was given, but I can't return home, both because I've come so far, and because I can't nearly afford it. What little I had after the long journey was spent on these accommodations.
				
				I told the old man as much, but he only nodded with a slight grin. It seems he anticipated this, and has made preperations for a distraction to occur right after the second bell of the night. He hasn't given me any more information, but has warned me that the stories are indeed true. There are great horrors beyond, but for every monster, there is a sight previously unseen; for every trial, there are bountiful riches belonging to those with the ingenuity to overcome...</text>

			<text>[5] I wanted to ask the old man many other questions, but he began walking towards the door, saying he must go to prepare. As he reached the doorframe, he turned to face me, again with a slight grin. 'The distraction will pull their attention, but will not last long. You won't be able to carry more than the clothes on your back, and the journal in your hands.
				
				Suddenly, his face lit with concerned emotion. 'Quickly, you don't have much time. The lands on the other side change people. You will quickly forget who you were... what you were.' He pointed to my journal, and told me to detail my appearance and personality. When I looked up, he had gone, yet his words hung in the air. 
				
				Compelled, and with an unexplainable sence of urgency, I write these words, and will write of myself on the following page.</text>
